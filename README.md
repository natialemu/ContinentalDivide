# ContinentalDivide

## Overview

Continental Divide is an android puzzle application as part of Google's Applied CS with Android workshop. It determines and maps the continental divide of a continental landmass. The phrase [continental divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas) is a geographical term for the boundary which divides a continent into parts where each part leads to a different body of water. A clever way to think about a continental divide is to imagine rain pouring down on an entire continent. The water in each of the various parts made by the divide would flow to a different body of water. The application also handles situations where a part of a landmass will have water flow into a lake.

## Data structures and Algorithms

- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f09/lectures/lect1001.pdf) used to determine the direction of flow of water at any point on the landmass
- [Diamond-Square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) used to generate realistic looking terrains
